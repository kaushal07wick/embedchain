Creating a chatbot involves 3 steps:

- ⚙️ Import the App instance
- 🗃️ Add Dataset
- 💬 Query or Chat on the dataset and get answers (Interface Types)

Run your first bot in python using the following code. Make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` 🔑 environment variable in the code.

```python
import os

from embedchain import App

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "xxx"
elon_musk_bot = App()

# Embed Online Resources
elon_musk_bot.add("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk")
elon_musk_bot.add("https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk")

response = elon_musk_bot.query("How many companies does Elon Musk run and name those?")
print(response)
# Answer: 'Elon Musk currently runs several companies. As of my knowledge, he is the CEO and lead designer of SpaceX, the CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., the CEO and founder of Neuralink, and the CEO and founder of The Boring Company. However, please note that this information may change over time, so it's always good to verify the latest updates.'
