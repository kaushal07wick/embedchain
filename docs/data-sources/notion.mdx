### Notion
To use notion you must install the extra dependencies with `pip install --upgrade embedchain[notion]`.

To load a notion page, use the data_type as `notion`. Since it is hard to automatically detect, forcing this is advised.
The next argument must **end** with the `notion page id`. The id is a 32-character string. Eg:

```python
app.add("cfbc134ca6464fc980d0391613959196", "notion")
app.add("my-page-cfbc134ca6464fc980d0391613959196", "notion")
app.add("https://www.notion.so/my-page-cfbc134ca6464fc980d0391613959196", "notion")
```
